# finance-machine-learning

This is what I've learned in the STAT430 at University Illinois at Urbana Champaign

### • Course Objectives

– After this course, you should be able to know:

∗ How to prepare various structured and unstructured data for financial machine learning;

∗ How to effectively choose and evaluate machine learning methods in solving various quantitative
problems in finance.

∗ How to effectively work in a computing environment powered by open-source software such as
R and Ubuntu. 

### • Course Topics

– Modern machine learning techniques that are tailored for analyzing financial data.

– Topics include Financial Data Preprocessing, Ensemble Methods, Cross Validation, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory / Gated Recurrent
Units, etc.

– The emphasis is on the basics of these methods and their relevant applications with financial data.

### • Textbooks

– Required: Advances in Financial Machine Learning, Marcos Lopez de Prado, 2018; – Required: Deep Learning with R, Francois Chollet, J. J. Allaire, 2018.
