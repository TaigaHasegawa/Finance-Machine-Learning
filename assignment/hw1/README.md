# Homework 1

### Description: 
In this homework, you will practice how to implement algorithms using R, how to construct various structured financial data from unstructured tick data, and how to compare results from different bars.

### Dataset: 
Please download the data of the Amazon stock from here. Please read the readme file and the following questions will be based on the message tick data “AMZN_2012-06-21_34200000_57600000_message_10.csv”.

### Practices:

1. Practice how to use R package lubridate to correctly convert the timestamp to human readable ones, and keep the decimals for millisecond information. Print out the first 5 rows of the converted data.

2. Develop R functions for the following bars, and try these functions with the order message data with Type == 4 or 5. You should submit the R codes, and summarize your findings, comparisons, and your thoughts.

• tick imbalance bars

• volume imbalance bars • tick runs bars

• volume runs bars
